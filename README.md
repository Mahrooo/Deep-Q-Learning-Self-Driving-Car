# Deep-Q-Learning-Self-Driving-Car
In this repository you can find a project for "[Artificial Intelligence A-Zâ„¢: Learn How To Build An AI](https://www.udemy.com/course/artificial-intelligence-az/)" course. In this project, I created a neural network to predict the action of a self-driving car in [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) environment with Deep-Q Learning algorithm.
